beagleboneblack-baremetal-tests
===============================

A collection of small binarys, sourcecode and
documentation/explanation for bare-metal programming
on the Beaglebone Black hardware.

CC0 1.0 Licence. See LICENCE file for details.

My hardware is a Beaglebone Black, Revision A5 (Not sure if A, B or C sub-revision).
Most of my development is done on a macbook running OSX, but the system can change as appropriate
(I have access to many different development machines).
